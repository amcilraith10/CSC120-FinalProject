# CSC120-FinalProject

Reflections on final project
This project had a lot of things I didn't anticipate coming up but I learned a lot.

I first had a lot of trouble figuring out how to interpret user input from the command line. My roommate Sophi helped me figure out how to do this so that I could interpret the verb part of the command and match it to a method, as well as the noun part of the command, so it could do what the user wanted (example command: "go south", verb = go, noun =  south)
